# Taskone

Created a game, which i have named it as hide_&_seek game. It refers to finding a number which a computer has generated. 

Basically it is composed with different levels to play and final score will be displayed at last. Needed to score required points to get enter into another level. Each action will affect on point. If the prediction is right, then gain points else loss points. 

Along with each level and points, hint is provided to find the number generated by the computer. The hint is dynamic. It will really help you to find the generated number. Like if your prediction is high then the number, it will give as "too high (try 10 to 15 add or subtract)"

### What the Hint Say?

"too high (try 10 to 15 add or subtract)". Try numbers from 10 to 15 and try to subtract or add from your previous guess to find the number.
